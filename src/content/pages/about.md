## Eliott Wantz - Software Engineer based in Montreal, Canada

**Greetings!** I'm Eliott Wantz, a passionate software engineer. I mainly focus on full-stack development, and am always seeking new challenges to grow as a developer. With a strong understanding of modern applications requirements and complexity, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise, following best practices, to ship high-quality solutions.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in front-end and back-end development, utilizing the latest technologies to build responsive and user-friendly web applications and APIs.

For _web applications_, I mainly use SvelteKit and Nextjs for full-stack development. Technologies I use on a daily basis include:
**Next.js**, **SvelteKit**, **Tailwind CSS**, **PostgreSQL**, **Drizzle**, **Oauth2**, **Stripe**, and more.

For backend javascript applications, I have used **Express** and **Nestjs**, but recently switched to [**Hono**](https://hono.dev/).

For more robust backend development, I use **Go** and recently used **Rust**. I have worked extensively with **Go**, creating **REST APIs** and integrating with databases such as **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**, but also game servers, or creating microservices for **Cloud Native applications**.

## Work Experience

I have worked professionally as a software engineer intern at [Ribbon Communications](https://ribboncommunications.com/) in the cloud native team where I used Go, **Kubernetes** (Openshift) and **Docker**. I have also worked as a data engineer intern at [Kruger Inc.](https://www.kruger.com/) where I built business intelligence dashboards foor internal teams using PowerBi and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Continuous Learning

The dynamic nature of the tech industry inspires me to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements. I'm always eager to expand my skill set and embrace emerging technologies that enhance the functionality and aesthetics of the websites I create.

## Collaboration and Communication

I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication. Whether working with clients, designers, or fellow developers, I value clear communication to ensure the success of every project.
